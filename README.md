> New files are not initially tracked by git, so they appear as `Untracked` when executing `git status`

> There are a few stages that a file can be in - Unstaged, Staged and Remote, but I might be wrong for the last one.

> To stage ALL unstaged files we can execute `git add .`, if we want to stage only specific ones we just enumerate them with `git add <list of file names>`

> Which branch I'm currently on? - `git branch`
